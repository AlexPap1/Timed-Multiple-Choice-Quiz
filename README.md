**Start of Test**

The test opens with a short statment telling the reader to press "Start!" to start the quiz.

Once pressed, the prompt and button will hide, and a question will populate along with four buttons with answers. A timer with 60 seconds will also appear.

**During the test**

If the player answers a question correctly, they will get one point added to their score for a highest possible score of 10.

If not, the player will lose 10 seconds off their 60 second timer.

**End of Test**

If the player answers all questions, or the timer runs to 0, they will be prompted with a "Quiz Over" note

The player will then be asked to give their initials, which will be displayed in the top left under "View High Scores" as a string containing their initials as well as their recorded score, saved to local storage.
